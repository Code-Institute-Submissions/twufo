## UX
To understand how to develop a game that will attract and entertain the end-user, we need to define the development process of each stage. This can be done by analyzing and breaking down the development process of the project into five planes:


### Strategy Plane & User Stories
The strategy plane defines the website's objective and the user needs (goals), which can be interpreted as user stories:

#### User Stories
As a game player I want to:
1. Enjoy playing the game
2. Read instructions that tells me how to play the game
3. Contact the owner of the website
4. See my high score

As a developer I want to:
1. Gain more knowledge on JavaScript
2. Entertain myself and the end-user by playing the game
3. Gameplayers to contact me for questions or remarks


### Scope Plane
The scope plane defines the features that are and are not possible to include in the website. This will be further in detail explained in the next chapter. A summary of the included and not included features are:

| Features (included) | Future features (not included)|

|1. Landing page: with navigation to game, instructions and contact form | 1. Ability to pause the game|
|2. Game page | 2. Leader board|
