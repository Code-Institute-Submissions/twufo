# TWUFO | A Memory Game
TWUFO is a memory game build to entertain the user and test the developer's knowledge of JavaScript. The theme of the website is 'space', which will be visible in various aspect of the game.  
The website contains an instruction page, a contact form, and the actual memory game. The result of this project is an interactive frontend website.

## UX
To understand how to develop a game that will attract and entertain the end-user, we need to define the development process of each stage. This can be done by analyzing and breaking down the development process of the project into five planes:


### Strategy Plane
The strategy plane defines the website's objective and the user needs (goals), which can be interpreted as user stories:

#### User Stories
As a **game player** I want to:
1. Enjoy playing the game
2. Read instructions that tells me how to play the game
3. Contact the owner of the website
4. See my high score

As a **developer** I want to:
1. Gain more knowledge on JavaScript
2. Entertain me and the end-user by playing the game
3. Gameplayers to contact me for questions or remarks

### Scope Plane
The scope plane defines the features that are and are not possible to include on the website.  
This will be further in detail explained in the next chapter. A summary of the included and not included features are:

| Features (included) | Future features (not included)|
| :------------- | :---------- |
|1. Landing page with navigation to game, instructions and contact form | 1. Ability to pause the game|
|2. Game page | 2. Ability to replay the computer sequence |
|3. Audio on/off button| 3. Leader board
|4. Instructions | 
|5. Contact form |  

### Structure Plane
The structure plane defines the information architecture and interaction design with the user.  
The following definitions has been used for this website:

- First impression of the website needs to be simple and clear as possible
- No more than two clicks are required for the user to reach a page
- The type of information architecture that will be used is the â€˜Hub and Spoke, see below:

### Skeleton Plane
The skeleton plane defines a basic visual design of the website through, for example, a wireframe.  
The wireframes for this project are made with Balsamiq can be downloaded from the following link:

- [Wireframe - Desktop version](https://github.com/MatthewYong/twufo/raw/master/readme/wireframes/Wireframe%20-%20Desktop.pdf)
- [Wireframe - Tablet version](https://github.com/MatthewYong/twufo/raw/master/readme/wireframes/Wireframe%20-%20Tablet.pdf)
- [Wireframe - Mobile version](https://github.com/MatthewYong/twufo/raw/master/readme/wireframes/Wireframe%20-%20Mobile.pdf)

Below you can find an example of a wireframe of the landing page.

### Surface Plane
The surface plane is the final plane in the design process and defines the appearance of the website. This website needs to encourage users to play the game. The website has a 'space' theme and must give the user a futuristic experience.  
The following design style has been used:

| Design Style | Design Choice|
| :------------- | :---------- |
Font: Orbitron | A clear font to give the website a futuristic look|
Text color: #00FF7F | A green bright 'alienish' colour |
Background: Earth from Space | To be in line with the space theme |
Contrast ratio: 9.98 | A high ratio to express the visibility of the text (source: contrast-ratio.com)|

2. Select an icon and while the icon is rotating click another icon
3. Verified that nothing will happen until the rotation of each icon has finished

#### Error on any player sequence
1. Click on Start button and succesfully play to the third level
2. At level three select a wrong icon on the second try
3. Verified that the game play has stopped while the player array length has not been fully pushed

### Jasmine Testing
For this project Jasmine has been used for testing the result of the code. However, Jasmine should have been used as a Test-Driven Development from the start of this project.  
Due to my basic knowledge of JavaScript, and Jasmine in general, this was unfortunately not possible.

#### Button Test
- To execute the test in twufo-jasmine-testing.html the JQuery 'document.ready' function in game.js needs to be temporarily removed
- Jasmine testing has been carried out specifically for buttons
- The results have all passed and can be found below:
