# TWUFO | A Memory Game
Milestone Project 2 - Code Institute 

TWUFO is a memory game build to entertain the user and test the developer's knowledge of JavaScript. The theme of the website is 'space', which will be visible in various aspect of the game. The website contains an instruction page,a contact form and the actual game. The result of this project is an interactive frontend website.

## UX
To understand how to develop a game that will attract and entertain the end-user, we need to define the development process of each stage. This can be done by analyzing and breaking down the development process of the project into five planes:


### Strategy Plane & User Stories
The strategy plane defines the website's objective and the user needs (goals), which can be interpreted as user stories:

#### User Stories
As a game player I want to:
1. Enjoy playing the game
2. Read instructions that tells me how to play the game
3. Contact the owner of the website
4. See my high score

As a developer I want to:
1. Gain more knowledge on JavaScript
2. Entertain myself and the end-user by playing the game
3. Gameplayers to contact me for questions or remarks

### Scope Plane
The scope plane defines the features that are and are not possible to include in the website. This will be further in detail explained in the next chapter. A summary of the included and not included features are:

| Features (included) | Future features (not included)|
| :------------- | :---------- |
|1. Landing page with navigation to game, instructions and contact form | 1. Ability to pause the game|
|2. Game page | 2. Ability to replay the computer sequence|
|3. Audio on/off button| 3. Leader board
|4. Instructions page | 
|5. Contact form|  

### Structure Plane
The structure plane defines the information architecture and interaction design with the user. The following definitions has been used for this website:

- First impression of the website needs to be simple and clear as possible
- No more than two clicks are required for the user to reach a page
- The type of information architecture that will be used is the â€˜Hub and Spoke, see below:

### Skeleton Plane
The skeleton plane defines a basic visual design of the website through, for example, a wireframe. The wireframes for this project are made with Balsamiq can be downloaded from the following link:

- [Wireframe - Mobile version](https://github.com/MatthewYong/twufo/raw/master/readme/wireframes/Wireframe%20-%20Mobile.pdf)

Below you can find an example of a wireframe of the landing page.

### Surface Plane
The surface plane is the final plane in the design process and defines the appearance of the website. This website needs to encourage users to play the game. The website has a 'space' theme and must give the user a futuristic experience. The following design style has been used:

| Design Style | Design Choice|
| :------------- | :---------- |
Font: Orbitron | A clear font to give the website a futuristic look|
Text color: #00FF7F | A green bright 'alienish' colour |
Background: Earth from Space | To be in line with the space theme |
Contrast ratio: 9.98 | A high ratio to express the visibility of the text (source: contrast-ratio.com)|


## Features
A summary of the features were described in the scope plane. This chapter will explain what the purpose is of each feature and what will left to implement for the future.

### Existing Features
| Features (included) | Explanation|
| :------------- | :---------- |
|1. Start button | 1. The start button allows users to to start the game|
|2. Back button | 2. The back button allows users to return to the landing page|
|3. Audio button | The audio button let users to control the sound of the game|
|4. Game icons | The five game icons allows users to interact with the game. The user needs to mimic a specific pattern that the computer has shown|
|5. Instructions page | The instructions page allows users to read the instructions of the game|
|6. Contact form | The contact form allows users to contact the owner of the website for questions or remarks|

### Features Left to Implement
| Features (not included) | Explanation|
